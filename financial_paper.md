### Problem and Hypothesis

Technical analysis vs. machine technical analysis - reasons why the latter is more theoretically sound (or less theoretically unsound, if you prefer)

### Data Provenance and General Modeling Approach

This is real financial data. Avoid ML-specific terminology and details; cover the idea of what the technique is trying to achieve, and how well it does it.

### Place inside a trading strategy

- cognitive aid to human trader
- weight in existing algo-driven models
- foundation of a pure AI-driven model

### Refinements to Approach

And the associated benefits from a finance perspective

### Conclusions

Shows promise; lots of upside for refinement and productionization
